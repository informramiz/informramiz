### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Ramiz and I love mobile development. Here are a few things about me

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working as a Sr. Android Developer at Plume, with Clean Code Architecture and Agile as the development model.
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently reading some cool books by Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob), like Clean Code Architecture, Clean Coder and Clean Agile.
- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate to some cool open-source projects.
